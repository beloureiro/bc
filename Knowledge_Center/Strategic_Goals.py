        After an extensive analysis of a dataset comprising approximately 50,000 customer reviews across three countries, 
        and considering the sentiment indicators tied to specific processes, I identified potential opportunities that extend beyond the initial scope of the business case. 
        As a result, I developed a strategic action plan aimed at supporting patient satisfaction, fostering loyalty, and potentially contributing to growth for DocPlanner.

        It's important to note that, due to the lack of direct validation with the DocPlanner team, some of the proposed actions might not align with the current strategies or may already be in place. However, I believe these suggestions could still offer value and serve as a starting point for further discussion and refinement.

        **I trust this additional insight will be valuable:)**

    **Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement:**

    - **Limited Focus on Pre-Consultation:** The value proposition concentrates only on the steps leading to booking, neglecting the patient's experience during and after the consultation.
    - **Unmanaged Expectations:** High ratings can create elevated expectations which, if unmet, lead to dissatisfaction and blame directed at both the doctor and DocPlanner.
    - **Shared Responsibility:** When expectations are not met, the platform is held accountable alongside the doctor, affecting its reputation and user trust.

    **Opportunities for Improvement:**

    - **Expand the Value Proposition:** Include elements that ensure patient satisfaction throughout the entire care cycle, not just up to the booking.
    - **Expectation Management:** Provide more detailed and accurate information about doctors' services and practices to align patient expectations.
    - **Post-Consultation Support:** Implement post-care support to handle possible dissatisfaction, preventing complaints directed at the platform.
