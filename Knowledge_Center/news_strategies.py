        The Enhanced Review System offers patients a structured and insightful way to assess healthcare professionals. Through this updated system, patients benefit from a more organized categorization of review criteria and detailed professional profiles. Key benefits include:

        1. **Structured Review System**: Patients can rate multiple aspects of their care experience, including waiting time, communication quality, value perception, and support staff attentiveness. This structured approach provides a more comprehensive and balanced view of the professional's care quality.
        2. **Detailed Profile View**: Each professional's profile includes an overall rating, availability, and in-depth ratings on specific aspects of care. The "Style of Care" section visually represents the doctor's approach, helping patients choose a provider that aligns with their expectations and personal preferences.
        3. **Patient Feedback Survey**: The interactive feedback survey allows patients to provide nuanced feedback on various care aspects. Patients rate experiences using a sliding scale, covering areas like environment satisfaction and interaction style, thereby enabling a tailored care alignment that benefits future patients.
        4. **Enhanced Patient Insights**: The categorized feedback enables patients to make well-informed choices based on detailed reviews, reducing uncertainty and promoting confidence before scheduling an appointment.
        5. **Transparency and Trust**: This system fosters transparency by showcasing authentic feedback, allowing healthcare providers to align their service with patient expectations effectively.

        Overall, this app enhances the decision-making process for both patients and healthcare providers by offering a clearer view of care experiences and aligning patient needs with professional care styles.

        The current review system allows patients to provide feedback on their healthcare experiences. This system has some limitations compared to more advanced review systems.

        Key points about the current review system:
        1. Simple star rating: Patients can rate their overall experience using a 5-star scale.
        2. Text-based feedback: There's an option for patients to leave written comments about their experience.
        3. Limited categorization: The system doesn't break down ratings into specific aspects of care.
        4. Basic display: The interface shows an average rating and individual reviews without detailed analytics.

        While this system provides valuable feedback, it has potential for improvement to offer more detailed insights and a better user experience for both patients and healthcare providers.
